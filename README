INTRODUCTION
This plugin was created to trend our puppetmaster[1] in two ways:
 1. We wanted to know the average compile time for configs over a amount of time
 2. We wanted to trend the total amount of nodes that have connected over the
   last day to the total of known hosts

This plugin is based on another plugin on munin exchange[2] by "ohadlevy@gmail.com".

USAGE
This plugin is named puppet_ it should be symlinked into /etc/munin/plugins as
either puppet_node or puppet_total(alternatively it can be puppet_nodes or
puppet_totals).
In your /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/puppet_ set the following:
 [puppet_*]
 user root

Like any munin plugin, this script has 2 commandline options, config and
autoconfig, which work as expected.

There are two enviroment variables that can be passed to it:
 puppet_logs - This should be a string that defines the puppet log file
               (by default it is "/var/log/syslog")
 num_minutes - Only useful when calling the plugin as puppet_node, see below

puppet_node
Running this plugin as puppet_node will report the total amount of compiled
catalogs/configs and their average compile time over the last 5 and 30 minutes.
These values can be altered by using the enviroment variable num_minutes.

num_minutes should be a string of any amount of integers separated by a
comma(,). Example: "5,30,60" will report the above metrics for the last
5, 30 and 60 minutes.

puppet_total
Running this plugin as puppet_total will report the total number of known nodes
and the total number of unique nodes that had their catalog compiled in the
last 24 hours.
